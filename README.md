Hi! I'm Samara, a master's student in Modeling, Data, and Predictions at the University of Alberta. My interests span data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling. I enjoy using these tools to solve complex problems, uncover insights from data, and build predictive models that make a real impact. I'm always eager to collaborate on projects, learn new methods, and apply my skills to challenging questions at the intersection of data science and mathematics.
